Welcome to cuNumeric's documentation!
=====================================

cuNumeric is a `Legate`_ library that aims to provide a distributed and
accelerated drop-in replacement for the `NumPy API`_ on top of the `Legion`_
runtime.

Using cuNumeric you do things like run the final example of the
`Python CFD course`_ completely unmodified on 2048 A100 GPUs in a
`DGX SuperPOD`_ and achieve good weak scaling.
