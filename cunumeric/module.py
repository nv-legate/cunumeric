    ----------
    object : array_like
        An array, any object exposing the array interface, an object whose
        __array__ method returns an array, or any (nested) sequence.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type for the array.  If not given, then the type will

    copy : bool, optional
        If true (default), then the object is copied.  Otherwise, a copy will
        only be made if __array__ returns a copy, if obj is a nested sequence,
        or if a copy is needed to satisfy any of the other requirements
        (`dtype`, `order`, etc.).
    order : {'K', 'A', 'C', 'F'}, optional
        Specify the memory layout of the array. If object is not an array, the
        newly created array will be in C order (row major) unless 'F' is
        specified, in which case it will be in Fortran order (column major).

        the same as if ``copy=True``, with some exceptions for 'A', see the
        Notes section. The default order is 'K'.
    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
        the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).
    ndmin : int, optional
        Specifies the minimum number of dimensions that the resulting

# Numerical ranges


def arange(start, stop=None, step=1, dtype=None):
    """
    arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None)

    Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.

    Values are generated within the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``
    (in other words, the interval including `start` but excluding `stop`).
    For integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in
    `range` function, but returns an ndarray rather than a list.

    When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, the results will often not
    be consistent.  It is better to use `cunumeric.linspace` for these cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : number, optional
        Start of interval.  The interval includes this value.  The default
        start value is 0.
    stop : number
        End of interval.  The interval does not include this value, except
        in some cases where `step` is not an integer and floating point
        round-off affects the length of `out`.
    step : number, optional
        Spacing between values.  For any output `out`, this is the distance
        between two adjacent values, ``out[i+1] - out[i]``.  The default
        step size is 1.  If `step` is specified as a position argument,
        `start` must also be given.
    dtype : dtype
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
        type from the other input arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    arange : ndarray
        Array of evenly spaced values.

        For floating point arguments, the length of the result is
        ``ceil((stop - start)/step)``.  Because of floating point overflow,
        this rule may result in the last element of `out` being greater

    """

    Return evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.

    Returns `num` evenly spaced samples, calculated over the
    interval [`start`, `stop`].

    The endpoint of the interval can optionally be excluded.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : array_like
        The starting value of the sequence.
    stop : array_like
        The end value of the sequence, unless `endpoint` is set to False.
        In that case, the sequence consists of all but the last of ``num + 1``
        evenly spaced samples, so that `stop` is excluded.  Note that the step
        size changes when `endpoint` is False.
    num : int, optional
        Number of samples to generate. Default is 50. Must be non-negative.
    endpoint : bool, optional
        If True, `stop` is the last sample. Otherwise, it is not included.
        Default is True.
    retstep : bool, optional
        If True, return (`samples`, `step`), where `step` is the spacing
        between samples.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
        type from the other input arguments.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis in the result to store the samples.  Relevant only if start
        or stop are array-like.  By default (0), the samples will be along a
        new axis inserted at the beginning. Use -1 to get an axis at the end.

    Returns
    -------
    samples : ndarray
        There are `num` equally spaced samples in the closed interval
        ``[start, stop]`` or the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``
        (depending on whether `endpoint` is True or False).
    step : float, optional
        Only returned if `retstep` is True

        Size of spacing between samples.

    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is

    to arrays of a common shape; calling these *Ba* and *Bchoices[i], i =

    for each ``i``.  Then, a new array with shape ``Ba.shape`` is created as
    follows:

    * if ``mode='raise'`` (the default), then, first of all, each element of
      ``a`` (and thus ``Ba``) must be in the range ``[0, n-1]``; now, suppose
      that ``i`` (in that range) is the value at the ``(j0, j1, ..., jm)``
      position in ``Ba`` - then the value at the same position in the new array
      is the value in ``Bchoices[i]`` at that same position;

    * if ``mode='wrap'``, values in `a` (and thus `Ba`) may be any (signed)

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : int array
        This array must contain integers in ``[0, n-1]``, where ``n`` is the
        number of choices, unless ``mode=wrap`` or ``mode=clip``, in which

    choices : sequence of arrays
        Choice arrays. `a` and all of the choices must be broadcastable to the

        its outermost dimension (i.e., the one corresponding to
        ``choices.shape[0]``) is taken as defining the "sequence".
    out : array, optional

    mode : {'raise' (default), 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional

        Axis to be used as the second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays from
        which the diagonals should be taken. Defaults to second axis (1).

    Returns
    -------
    array_of_diagonals : ndarray
        If `a` is 2-D, then a 1-D array containing the diagonal and of the
        same type as `a` is returned unless `a` is a `matrix`, in which case
        a 1-D array rather than a (2-D) `matrix` is returned in order to
        maintain backward compatibility.

        If ``a.ndim > 2``, then the dimensions specified by `axis1` and `axis2`
        are removed, and a new axis inserted at the end corresponding to the
        diagonal.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the dimension of `a` is less than 2.

@add_boilerplate("a", "b")
def dot(a, b, out=None):
    """

    Dot product of two arrays. Specifically,

    - If both `a` and `b` are 1-D arrays, it is inner product of vectors
      (without complex conjugation).

    - If both `a` and `b` are 2-D arrays, it is matrix multiplication,
      but using :func:`matmul` or ``a @ b`` is preferred.

    - If either `a` or `b` is 0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to
      :func:`multiply` and using ``cunumeric.multiply(a, b)`` or ``a * b`` is
      preferred.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over
      the last axis of `a` and `b`.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is an M-D array (where ``M>=2``), it is a
      sum product over the last axis of `a` and the second-to-last axis of
      `b`::

        dot(a, b)[i,j,k,m] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[k,:,m])

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        First argument.
    b : array_like
        Second argument.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
        if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
        C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
        for `dot(a,b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
        conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
        to be flexible.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are both
        scalars or both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned; otherwise
        an array is returned.
        If `out` is given, then it is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the last dimension of `a` is not the same size as
        the second-to-last dimension of `b`.

    `a`'s and `b`'s elements (components) over the axes specified by

    integer_like scalar, ``N``; if it is such, then the last ``N`` dimensions
    of `a` and the first ``N`` dimensions of `b` are summed over.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like
        Tensors to "dot".

    axes : int or (2,) array_like
        * integer_like
          If an int N, sum over the last N axes of `a` and the first N axes

    Test whether all array elements along a given axis evaluate to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a logical AND reduction is performed.
        The default (``axis=None``) is to perform a logical AND over all
        the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

        If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.
        It must have the same shape as the expected output and its
        type is preserved (e.g., if ``dtype(out)`` is float, the result
        will consist of 0.0's and 1.0's). See `ufuncs-output-type` for more
        details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a logical OR reduction is performed.
        The default (``axis=None``) is to perform a logical OR over all
        the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

        If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
        the same shape as the expected output and its type is preserved
        (e.g., if it is of type float, then it will remain so, returning
        1.0 for True and 0.0 for False, regardless of the type of `a`).
        See `ufuncs-output-type` for more details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `any` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    any : bool or ndarray
        A new boolean or `ndarray` is returned unless `out` is specified,
        in which case a reference to `out` is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a product is performed.  The default,
        axis=None, will calculate the product of all the elements in the
        input array. If axis is negative it counts from the last to the
        first axis.

        If axis is a tuple of ints, a product is performed on all of the
        axes specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the
        axes as before.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in
        which the elements are multiplied.  The dtype of `a` is used by
        default unless `a` has an integer dtype of less precision than the
        default platform integer.  In that case, if `a` is signed then the
        platform integer is used while if `a` is unsigned then an unsigned
        integer of the same precision as the platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
        values will be cast if necessary.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the
        result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result
        will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `prod` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial : scalar, optional
        The starting value for this product. See `~cunumeric.ufunc.reduce` for
        details.

    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the product. See `~cunumeric.ufunc.reduce` for
        details.

    Returns
    -------
    product_along_axis : ndarray, see `dtype` parameter above.
        An array shaped as `a` but with the specified axis removed.

    Notes
    -----
    The floor division operator ``//`` was added in Python 2.2 making
    ``//`` and ``/`` equivalent operators.  The default floor division
    operation of ``/`` can be replaced by true division with ``from
    __future__ import division``.

    In Python 3.0, ``//`` is the floor division operator and ``/`` the
    true division operator.  The ``true_divide(x1, x2)`` function is
    equivalent to true division in Python.
