    Computes the inverse of `rfft`.

    This function computes the inverse of the one-dimensional *n*-point
    discrete Fourier Transform of real input computed by `rfft`.
    In other words, ``irfft(rfft(a), len(a)) == a`` to within numerical
    accuracy. (See Notes below for why ``len(a)`` is necessary here.)

    The input is expected to be in the form returned by `rfft`, i.e. the
    real zero-frequency term followed by the complex positive frequency terms
    in order of increasing frequency.  Since the discrete Fourier Transform of
    real input is Hermitian-symmetric, the negative frequency terms are taken
    to be the complex conjugates of the corresponding positive frequency terms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The input array.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output.
        For `n` output points, ``n//2+1`` input points are necessary.  If the
        input is longer than this, it is cropped.  If it is shorter than this,
        it is padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given, it is taken to be
        ``2*(m-1)`` where ``m`` is the length of the input along the axis
        specified by `axis`.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the inverse FFT. If not given, the last
        axis is used.
    norm : ``{"backward", "ortho", "forward"}``, optional
        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
        is scaled and with what normalization factor.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.
        The length of the transformed axis is `n`, or, if `n` is not given,
        ``2*(m-1)`` where ``m`` is the length of the transformed axis of the
        input. To get an odd number of output points, `n` must be specified.

    Notes
    ------
    This is really `irfftn` with different defaults.
    For more details see `irfftn`.

    axes : sequence of ints, optional

    Computes the inverse of `rfftn`.

    This function computes the inverse of the N-dimensional discrete
    Fourier Transform for real input over any number of axes in an
    M-dimensional array by means of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  In
    other words, ``irfftn(rfftn(a), a.shape) == a`` to within numerical
    accuracy. (The ``a.shape`` is necessary like ``len(a)`` is for `irfft`,
    and for the same reason.)

    The input should be ordered in the same way as is returned by `rfftn`,
    i.e. as for `irfft` for the final transformation axis, and as for `ifftn`
    along all the other axes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length of each transformed axis) of the output
        (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.). `s` is also the
        number of input points used along this axis, except for the last axis,
        where ``s[-1]//2+1`` points of the input are used.
        Along any axis, if the shape indicated by `s` is smaller than that of
        the input, the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded
        with zeros. If `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes
        specified by axes is used. Except for the last axis which is taken to
        be ``2*(m-1)`` where ``m`` is the length of the input along that axis.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the inverse FFT. If not given, the last
        `len(s)` axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
        Repeated indices in `axes` means that the inverse transform over that
        axis is performed multiple times.
    norm : ``{"backward", "ortho", "forward"}``, optional
        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
        is scaled and with what normalization factor.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or by a combination of `s` or `a`,
        as explained in the parameters section above.
        The length of each transformed axis is as given by the corresponding
        element of `s`, or the length of the input in every axis except for the
        last one if `s` is not given.  In the final transformed axis the length
        of the output when `s` is not given is ``2*(m-1)`` where ``m`` is the
        length of the final transformed axis of the input.  To get an odd
        number of output points in the final axis, `s` must be specified.
