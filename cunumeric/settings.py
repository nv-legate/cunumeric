        Force cuNumeric to always use a specific strategy for backing
        ndarrays: "deferred", i.e. managed by the Legate runtime, which

        up-front offloading overhead, or "eager", i.e. falling back to
        using a vanilla NumPy array. By default cuNumeric will decide
        this on a per-array basis, based on the size of the array and
        the accelerator in use.
