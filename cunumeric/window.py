def bartlett(M: int) -> ndarray:
    """

    Return the Bartlett window.

    The Bartlett window is very similar to a triangular window, except
    that the end points are at zero.  It is often used in signal
    processing for tapering a signal, without generating too much
    ripple in the frequency domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an
        empty array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The triangular window, with the maximum value normalized to one
        (the value one appears only if the number of samples is odd), with
        the first and last samples equal to zero.

def blackman(M: int) -> ndarray:
    """

    Return the Blackman window.

    The Blackman window is a taper formed by using the first three
    terms of a summation of cosines. It was designed to have close to the
    minimal leakage possible.  It is close to optimal, only slightly worse
    than a Kaiser window.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an empty
        array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The window, with the maximum value normalized to one (the value one
        appears only if the number of samples is odd).

def hamming(M: int) -> ndarray:
    """

    Return the Hamming window.

    The Hamming window is a taper formed by using a weighted cosine.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an
        empty array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The window, with the maximum value normalized to one (the value
        one appears only if the number of samples is odd).

def hanning(M: int) -> ndarray:

    Return the Hanning window.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an
        empty array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The window, with the maximum value normalized to one (the value
        one appears only if `M` is odd).

def kaiser(M: int, beta: float) -> ndarray:
    """

    Return the Kaiser window.

    The Kaiser window is a taper formed by using a Bessel function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an
        empty array is returned.
    beta : float
        Shape parameter for window.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The window, with the maximum value normalized to one (the value
